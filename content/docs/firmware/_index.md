# Important!

This page is out of date! Most recent EggsWorks keyboards use ZMK! See [our ZMK Config repo](https://github.com/eggsworks/zmk-config) to download firmware for all boards not listed here.

## Firmware

We use QMK and VIA firmware for our boards. For more information or installation instructions, visit the [QMK website](https://docs.qmk.fm/) or [VIA website](https://www.caniusevia.com/).
 
## Egg58

The egg58 is now supported in the official QMK and VIA repositories. As of June 1, 2023, the prebuilt egg58 has shipped with VIA support by default.

If you're interested in tinkering with ZMK instead, a working configuration repo is available to reference [here](https://github.com/eggsworks/zmk-config/tree/master/config/boards/shields/egg58bt) (but is not officially supported at this time).
